= SPEC-1: Creo IDE - Integrated Development Environment for CreoLang
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

Creo IDE is the official integrated development environment (IDE) designed specifically for CreoLang. CreoLang is a versatile and innovative programming language tailored for a wide range of modern software development needs including web and mobile development, blockchain, smart contracts, machine learning, data analysis, quantum computing, and AR/VR/XR/MR development.

The creation of Creo IDE was driven by the need to provide developers with a powerful, efficient, and intuitive tool that fully leverages the advanced features of CreoLang. By integrating support for multiple programming languages and offering a suite of robust development tools, Creo IDE aims to enhance productivity and streamline the development process across various domains.

== Requirements

The requirements for Creo IDE are categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization method:

=== Must Have
* Multi-Language Support: Support for CreoLang, Python, Rust, Solidity, Go, C#, C++, Swift, JavaScript, and more.
* Intelligent Code Assistance: Advanced code completion, error detection, and real-time linting for CreoLang and other supported languages.
* Integrated Debugging Tools: Sophisticated debugging tools including smart contract debugging and quantum simulation.
* Version Control Integration: Built-in support for Git, SVN, and Mercurial with visual diff tools and merge conflict resolution.
* Project Management: Powerful project explorer, search functionality, and file organization.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Smooth operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

=== Should Have
* Plugin Ecosystem: Support for a wide range of plugins and extensions for additional functionality.
* Customization: Options to customize themes, keybindings, and layout configurations.
* Built-In Documentation: Comprehensive documentation and tutorials within the IDE interface.

=== Could Have
* Biometric Authentication: Option to enable biometric authentication for enhanced security.
* Blockchain Wallet Integration: Tools to create and manage blockchain wallets.
* Quantum Computing Tools: Advanced quantum computing functionalities.
* AR/VR/XR/MR Development Tools: Specific tools and features to support AR/VR/XR/MR development.

=== Won't Have
* Deprecated Technologies: No support for outdated or deprecated programming languages and technologies.

== Method

To address the requirements of Creo IDE, the following technical design and architecture have been proposed:
