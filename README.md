     ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone the CreoIDE repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/CreoDAMO/CreoIDE.git
     ```

4. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
   - Change to the directory that contains the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd CreoIDE
     ```

5. **Run Installation Scripts or Commands:**
   - If CreoIDE has an installation script or makefile, execute it as per the instructions provided in the repository's README or documentation.

}

// Define a command to build the entire CreoLang project
command buildProject(projectName: String, configuration: String) -> Bool {
    // Logic to build all files in the project with the specified configuration
    // Return true if the build is successful, false otherwise
}

// Define a command to test the CreoLang project
command testProject(projectName: String, testSuite: String) -> Bool {
    // Logic to run tests for the project using the specified test suite
    // Return true if tests pass, false otherwise
